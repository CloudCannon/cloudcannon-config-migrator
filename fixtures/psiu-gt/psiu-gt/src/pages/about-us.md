# Who We Are

Nice to meet you! We are Psi Upsilon’s Gamma Tau chapter and we’re Georgia Tech’s only and _premier_ gender inclusive social fraternity. Founded in 1970, we have a rich history that spans decades.

Psi Upsilon is a gender-inclusive fraternity. We don't only have men. A brother can be any gender. They're still called brothers. Never a miscommunication. You can't explain that. It's true: Psi Upsilon is the only gender-inclusive social fraternity on campus. It may seem a bit strange, but stop by and you'll soon discover that "normal" isn't a word used around here very often. Ever wondered who would win in a fight between Cthulhu and Beowulf? Ever made spreadsheets in order to better raise your Pokemans? Ever burst into song during Disney's Mulan? Ever try to replace your body parts with those of dinosaurs during a game of D&D? Ever wanted to pet a badger? I think five examples are enough; let's move on. One of the most commonly uttered phrases by the brothers here is "I never thought I'd join a fraternity," and if you stick around it won't take long for you figure out why. Psi Upsilon can be summed up by our rush motto: Individual standards, not standard individuals. For example, some of our brothers wear dresses...and not just the female ones. Some of our brothers play Magic: The Gathering and some of our brothers heckle them while they do it. Some of our brothers love to dance and some of our brothers stand awkwardly in corners. Some of our brothers are hardcore metal heads; some are hipsters—but only in an ironic sort of way. In our spare time, some of us tinker around with our wireless network while others battle it out with Foosball. Some of us throw pennies from the rooftops, some make ice cream with liquid nitrogen, some color all over our walls, and some adore playing with fire. We all enjoy different things, but at the end of the day, we all live under the same roof. Long story short, we're a pretty diverse group of people. Rush Psi Upsilon! You too might be worthy of joining our fighting force of extraordinary magnitude.

### “I don't know if I’m the fraternity type…”

Neither did we! In fact, one of the most common things you’ll hear about our members' experiences is that they never intended to rush or join a fraternity. Our culture is rooted heavily in being a non-traditional and non-stereotypical fraternity. We might share a lot of the same values of brotherhood that other fraternities do, but we pride ourselves on being an incredibly diverse group of people. We have brothers that make sure to get tickets for every Jackets game, but we also have brothers that spend their time playing D&D, writing music, or whining about Java. We go to Dragon\*Con, we go camping, and we go on spontaneous adventures.

## Our History

The Gamma Tau Chapter of Psi Upsilon was founded in 1970.

#### From the Technique March 12, 1971

> The members of Gamma Tau Chapter hope to add a new dimension to the already sound and healthy fraternity system at Tech. They hope to remain a relatively small group of friends who hold close fraternal ties in the original tradition of social fraternities.
>
> They feel at times, Tech fraternities have allowed counting intramural sports points and having a party every two weeks supersede the original goals of friendship and service for which the fraternity was founded. Tech's fraternities have made tremendous social and moral contributions in the past, and the new fraternity wishes to help make more in the future.
>
> The fraternity does not believe that the pledge is a second-class citizen. That is true in that the Brothers feel a pledge is merely a person being considered for membership in Psi Upsilon's order, not a slave or person who can be degraded to see if he "can take it."
>
> Hazing, Hell Week, and other diversions that Brothers practiced on pledges in the 1920's belongs there, in the 1920's. Psi Upsilon believes that a fraternity and its pledges have more important things they can do; things they can help their school, city, country, and therefore, themselves.

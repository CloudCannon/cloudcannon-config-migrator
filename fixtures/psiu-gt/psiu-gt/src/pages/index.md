      "Welcome to the Gamma Tau Chapter of Psi Upsilon, Georgia Tech’s only gender-inclusive
      social fraternity! We are a tight knit group of brothers who appreciate and encourage
      diversity in all forms; whether you’re interested in video games, music, flow
      arts, or anything else, we have a place for you!<br><br>We are a mix of everything:
      gamers, mad scientists, adventurers, musicians, and more! On a weekly basis you
      can find our brothers volunteering around Atlanta, studying hard, mentoring each
      other, and connecting with our many distinguished alumni. <br><br>Feel free to
      peruse our social media to see all of our crazy events and then stop by our house
      (831 Techwood Drive NW) and play on our arcade cabinets, join in on a game of
      Smash, jam out on the porch, or just observe our strange behavior.<br>"

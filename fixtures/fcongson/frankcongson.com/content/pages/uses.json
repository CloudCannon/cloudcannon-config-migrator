I love the versatile focal length of the 35mm (52.5mm equivalent on the crop sensor), and the f1.8 aperture is amazing for low light and creamy bokeh.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/lenses/aps-c-e-mount/p/sel1670z\">Sony 16-70mm f4</a><br>The perfect lens to go with the a6000.

I've used this the most throughout my travel.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras\">GoPro HERO5 Black</a><br>For when the elements get harsh. I've taken this climbing up rock faces and snorkeling in the ocean.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/nz/newsroom/2020/10/apple-introduces-iphone-12-pro-and-iphone-12-pro-max-with-5g/\">iPhone 12 Pro</a><br>The best camera is the one you have with you.
